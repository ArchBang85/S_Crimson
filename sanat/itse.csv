"Your body. Bare, clothes gone in a fire (your fire). The pieces of dark iron in your meat show here and there, in places you rarely looked at. Now you see them, still silent, silently accusing. You know by name what wreathes within, the precise positions of your bone scaffolding. How strange your limbs and inner pipes now sit. "
"You try and remember the proportions of your face. Its peaks and troughs are tender to the touch. Examining the beacons of pain across your body provide the rough map of a broken territory, pain below and a head about to split. You want to vomit but manage to push out only iridescent vapour."
"Your body, fifth decade male. Limbs as if made from wood. Once it spoke to the surf, now it is the surf itself."
"A naked figure, with scant hair and sunken eyes, moss where teeth used to be. Streams of dried blood and excrement colour the legs. "
This is you. Moving is difficult. Remembering words is difficult.
