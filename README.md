2014 7DRL

Hello & thanks for stopping by. This is my dilettante's entry to the 2014 7DRL. 

It's my first Roguelike game and much remains to improve but it achieves a bit of the (dark) mood and vision I intended, 
plus it is completable and has a somewhat interesting spell system and not-quite-trivial combat. 

============

How to get it up and running:

19/3/2014 - I had some trouble compiling the thing with Pyinstaller, but it all seems to work fine if you download the files and run Shitcrimson.py in a Python 2.7 interpreter.
            I will get a working compiled version on as soon as I can.

============

Synopsis:

You, ostensibly a man in middle age, are dying a miserable death. Something eats away at your bowels. 
Your disease, or the medication you are taking for it, is bringing out the things you have locked away 
over the years. Your mind and memory are failing, but you feel compelled to try and make amends with your complicated past. Perhaps you are able to come to accept your traumas. You do not have much in this house of yours, but you
feel it might listen to you, the house or some more stable part of your mind. You can try to appeal to this
power by calling out the words it recognises, word you will need to discover or invent. Maybe confronting your 
apparitions will help. Dying well is not easy but you will try.
